    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are various methods to secure your website from potential threats. 
      There are a few common threats to be aware of. These are: Cross-Site scripting, SQL injection,
      and Cross-Site request forgery. Something you can do to protect your users accounts is to use an open-standard 
      authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin. This will ensure that authorization and authentification is more secure.
      Also always make sure that third-party applications that you utilize are well known and trusted.
